1. The headers of the input being used to test should be passed in as 'headers' in data_processing.py
2. The class variable of the data set should be the last column
3. After you run the data_processing.py it will create a csv file in the local and fetch that as input,so please give the same path in the respective data_processing and dataset.py.For example data_processing1 is the input and pre processing file for dataset1.py and its the same with (data_processing2.py, dataset2.py) , (data_processing3.py, dataset3.py)
4. So the path in the last line of the data preprocessing  file should be same as the path given in the corresponding dataset.py file.
5. When the code starts running , enter the minimum support count as integer, allow the code to produce results for subdivision (a) to (c) then enter the minimum confidence interval for the remaining subdivisions to work.
6. The second user input(minimum confidence interval) should always be lesser than hundred(100).
7. The code is developed in such a way that it will only work for categorical files.
